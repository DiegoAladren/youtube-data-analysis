# YouTube Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of YouTube trending videos in the US.  
Using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we clean, preprocess, and visualize the dataset to extract meaningful insights about video performance, trends, and user engagement.

The analysis includes:
- Average and total views per category
- Likes, dislikes, and comment ratios
- Trends over time
- Correlation between key metrics
